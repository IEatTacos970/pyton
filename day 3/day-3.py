# Math and conditions

# math

# +, -, multiplication = *, division = /

print(6 + 7)
print(6 - 7)
print(6 * 7)
print(6 / 7)


# manipulate variables

number = 6
number2 = 7
number3 = number + number2
print(number3)


# conditions

# >, <, ==, !=


# if statements, make them untrue aswell to demonstrate

number = 6
number2 = 7

if number < number2:
    print("number is smaller than number2")

number = 67
number2 = 67

if number == number2:
    print("they are equal")



# add the else

number = 67
number2 = 67

if number == number2:
    print("they are equal")
else:
    print("they are not equal")


# elif

number = 6

if number > number2:
    print("number is bigger than number2")
elif number < number2:
    print("number is smaller than number2")
elif number == number2:
    print("they are equal")



# math, if else quiz

# ALSO: DO INT(INPUT()) -- very important
