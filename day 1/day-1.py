# Python’s Name and History
# Python is not named after the snake; its creator Guido van Rossum named it after the British comedy show "Monty Python’s Flying Circus".

# It was originally started as a hobby project by van Rossum in December 1989 to keep himself busy over Christmas.

# Unique Features
# Python does not use braces (curly brackets) to organize code. Instead, it uses indentation, which makes the code clean and readable.

# Unlike C++ or Java, Python doesn’t need a compiler and is interpreted directly, making the debugging process easier.

# Python allows users to assign values to multiple variables in one line and supports functions that return multiple values at once.

# If you enter “import this” in a Python terminal, it prints “The Zen of Python,” a poem outlining the core philosophies and design principles of the language.

# Popularity and Usage
# Python has become so popular that, in the UK in 2015, more parents wanted their children to learn Python than French, and it became the most popular language in primary schools.

# Many big-name companies use Python, including IBM, NASA, Netflix, Spotify, Google, and Facebook.

# Miscellaneous Trivia
# Python comes in many “flavors,” such as CPython, Jython (Java), and PyPy (Python implemented in Python itself).

# Typing “import antigravity” in Python opens up a web comic about Python, celebrating the fun and quirky side of the language.

## syntax

## text uses quotations
## everything else is plain

## function syntax. they are used to run code in just one line (will explain deeper later)

exampleFunction()
exampleFunctionWithParameter("example")


# hello world

print("Hello World") # can use any datatype, remember that for tomorrow


# quiz on hello world

# mini project: write code that introduces yourself
